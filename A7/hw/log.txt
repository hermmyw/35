Following the instructions on http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/BeagleBone_Green/#update-to-latest-software
Note: need to write the image to eMMC.

1. SSH to BB
$ sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2
	It gives WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!
$ ssh-keygen -R 192.168.7.2
	Since I did an SSH before I flashed my BB, the host key is already stored in 192.168.7.2.
	Remove the old host key.
$ sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2
The authenticity of host '192.168.7.2 (192.168.7.2)' can't be established.

Permission denied, please try again.

$ sudo ssh -X debian@192.168.7.2
	Since I could not figure out the password for root, I decide to log in as debian, which is also a sudo user.
$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for debian: temppwd
	From debian, I upgrade to root privilege.
